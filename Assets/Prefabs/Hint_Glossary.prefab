      a signal to an item on the track, right-click the signal, then right-click the
      item that you want to connect it to. Hover over the signal to make sure that
      the connection has been made.

      one semaphore. When closed (the top image) arrows cannot pass through the semaphore.
      When open (the bottom image) arrows can pass through the semaphore. You can
      right click on an unlocked semaphore to switch its default state.
